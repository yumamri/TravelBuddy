# TravelBuddy
Android Application

## Description : 
This is a convenient travel partner application to accompany users on their travel keeping all their documents in one place.
## Motivation : 
My motivation is to develop a modern instinctive application for travel. During one summer I was visiting multiple countries and I had tickets from different applications, it was confusing finding the correct application for the situation. This inconvenience inspired me to develop such application.
## MoSCoW : 
- Must have : 
    - Ability to capture photos
    - Send the photos to the cloud
    - Google login services
- Should have : 
    - Travel reminder notification
    - Travel checklist
    - Offline mode
- Could have :
    - Download the photos from the cloud
    - Checklist reminder if checklist isn't completed
    - Travel info of the country
    - Sharing trip system
    - Dark mode
    - Map of chosen location
- Won't have :
    - Friend system 

## Minor Hugs :
- User is disconnected on opening file picker
- Logging out causes a database error 
- Updating doesn't update in real time due to child event listener
- After updating a trip, this can cause a path error to the database or a corrupted entry into the database
- There is no logout service
- Notifications were not implemented
- The photos are saved onto the cloud but cannot be accessed from the application
- The date is just a string
- Dark mode never saw light of the application
- Who needs friends? (I do) Sadly a friend system didn't get implemented
- Also no one can flex on this app by sharing a trip but they can still go see someone physically and show the app directly (not Virus friendly though)
- Travel info of the country isn't implemented due to the developper not searching for a suitable API
- That also means countries have to be typed up
- There is no map (the designer of this application was too ambitious)
- After coding for almost a hundred hours in total, at the end of the day, the developper is seeing things more blurry even though the developper has glasses
