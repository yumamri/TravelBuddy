# TravelBuddy
Android Application

## Description : 
This is a convenient travel partner application to accompany users on their travel keeping all their documents in one place.
## Motivation : 
My motivation is to develop a modern instinctive application for travel. During one summer I was visiting multiple countries and I had tickets from different applications, it was confusing finding the correct application for the situation. This inconvenience inspired me to develop such application.
